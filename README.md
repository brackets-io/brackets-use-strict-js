brackets-use-strict-js
======================

Adds the 'use strict;' statement to the top of your JS file on save.

Two menu options:
- Enable Strict Mode: Immediately checks the current file for the use strict statement.
- Enable Strict Mode On Save (Ctrl-Shift-J): Checks the current file when saved.

# To do
- Add support for the function form.
- Publish to the Brackets extension registry.

# Limitations
- Doesn't currently support the "function form" of 'use strict'.  Not yet sure how to evaluate this.
