brackets-use-strict-js
======================

Adds the 'use strict;' statement to the top of your JS file on save.

# To do
- Add a hotkey sequence (useful when creating a new file).
- Add support for the function form.
- Publish to the Brackets extension registry.

# Limitations
- Doesn't currently support the "function form" of 'use strict'.  Not yet sure how to evaluate this.
