brackets-use-strict-js
======================

Adds the `use strict;` statement to the top of your JS file on save.

Two menu options:
- __Enable Strict Mode__: Immediately checks the current file for the use strict statement.
- __Enable Strict Mode On Save (Ctrl-Shift-J)__: Checks the current file when saved.

# To do
- Add support for the function form.
- Publish to the Brackets extension registry.

# Limitations
- Doesn't currently support the "function form" of 'use strict'.  Not yet sure how to evaluate this.
